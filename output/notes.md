**Source:** Expert Research Scientist at a leading AI startup (6+ years experience).

### Introduction: A Modern Approach to Learning ML

*   **Core Idea:** Learning Machine Learning in 2025 primarily requires a laptop and a structured list of steps, leveraging abundant new resources.
*   **Speaker's Credibility:** Personal experience as a research scientist after 6+ years, emphasizing the evolution of learning resources.
*   **Objective:** To outline the speaker's recommended **six key steps** for learning ML from scratch in 2025.

### Step 1: Learn Python Fundamentals

*   **Rationale:** Python is the universal programming language for Machine Learning. A strong foundation is crucial as subsequent steps build upon it.
*   **Required Concepts:**
    *   Lists, Dictionaries (differences and usage)
    *   For loops, If-else statements
    *   List comprehension
    *   Class inheritance
*   **Learning Strategy:**
    *   Utilize free online resources (YouTube, Google for "beginner Python tutorial").
    *   **Crucial Tip:** Always code along actively.
    *   **Time Management:** Don't get stuck perfecting Python if you already know how to code; focus on ML-specific needs.

### Step 2: Build Small, Fun Python Projects

*   **Purpose:** To apply basic Python knowledge immediately and build confidence.
*   **Examples:** Calculator, simple website, Snake game, other beginner Python projects.
*   **Approach:**
    *   Focus on having fun and immediate application of basics.
    *   Avoid spending excessive time at this stage; it's a stepping stone, not the final destination.

### Step 3: Master Fundamental Mathematics

*   **Key Insight:** Complex math is often *not* required for many ML roles; fundamental concepts suffice for most ML engineers and day-to-day tasks. More is needed for research.
*   **Core Math Topics (3-4 essential areas):**
    1.  **Calculus Basics:** Derivatives and Integrals (integrals less frequently critical).
    2.  **Linear Algebra:** Vectors and Matrices (basic operations, intuition).
    3.  **Probability Theory:** Fundamental concepts, especially Bayes' Rule.
    4.  **Useful Tricks:** Log rules, Summation rules (picked up along the way).
*   **Learning Resources:**
    *   **Primary Recommendation:** "Why Machines Learn" (book) – praised for teaching math in the context of ML, building intuition, and covering topics like linear equations, vectors, matrices, gradient descent, and probability.
    *   **Supplemental Resources:**
        *   YouTube/Google: For specific concepts not fully covered or understood in the book (e.g., how to do derivatives).
        *   **LLMs (Large Language Models):** Surprisingly powerful for asking questions, but **use with caution** due to potential for "hallucinations" (factually incorrect information).
        *   **Khan Academy:** A general recommendation for structured math courses.
    *   **Goal:** Intuitive understanding, especially for probability.

### Step 4: Learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning Fundamentals

*   **Distinction:** Classical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are distinct but interconnected; both are crucial.
*   **A. Classical Machine Learning:**
    *   **Importance:** Core knowledge, even if less "flashy" than deep neural networks.
    *   **Recommended Resource:** Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization course.
        *   **Content:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Recommender Systems, practical ML development advice.
        *   **Key Benefit:** Practical exercises, implementing first ML pipelines, training models with TensorFlow.
*   **B. Deep Learning (Crucial Decision Point):**
    *   **Path 1: Applied Deep Learning (Job-Oriented)**
        *   **Goal:** Understand current techniques, apply models to problems, get a job quickly. Focus on application over deep theory.
        *   **Resources:**
            *   Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization (for fundamentals and practical coding).
            *   Stanford's CS25 series (YouTube) – specifically for Transformer architecture (not fully covered by Ng).
            *   Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos (code along).
    *   **Path 2: Deep Understanding & Research-Oriented**
        *   **Goal:** Learn deep learning theory thoroughly, explore non-conventional models, apply math in complex ways, prepare for top companies or research.
        *   **Primary Resource:** "Understanding Deep Learning" (book/free PDF online).
            *   **Content:** Comprehensive coverage of deep learning models, theoretical and practical exercises. Strong emphasis on Transformer architecture.
            *   **Note:** Less coverage on RNNs/LSTMs due to modern focus on Transformers.
        *   **Learning Pace:** A dense book; mix working through it with practical projects (Step 5).

### Step 5: Hands-On Projects (Continuous Application)

*   **Core Principle:** ML is empirical and practical; coding is essential for any role.
*   **Essential Libraries/Frameworks:**
    *   **Data Manipulation/Visualization:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (20-min tutorials often suffice for basics).
    *   **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Jax. (Learn by applying through tutorials).
*   **Project Progression:**
    1.  **Kaggle:** Start with beginner/easier competitions to avoid frustration. Don't expect to win prizes initially. Progress to more advanced challenges.
    2.  **Bigger, Challenging Projects (Beyond Jupyter Notebooks):**
        *   **Favorite Method:** Re-implementing a research paper.
            *   **Benefits:** Learn a ton, read papers, understand existing code, potentially improve upon existing work (researcher/engineer level).
            *   **Caution:** Choose a paper appropriate for your skill level to avoid demotivation.
*   **Mindset:** Your first few projects won't be perfect. Improvement comes with each successive project.

### Bonus Tip: Show Your Work & Build a Presence (Ongoing)

*   **Importance:** Crucial for demonstrating skills, attracting opportunities (internships, jobs), and networking.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Beginner:** Short posts on X (Twitter) or LinkedIn about learned fundamentals.
    *   **Intermediate:** Blog posts explaining new deep learning techniques or project work. Create working demo websites for projects. (Example: Speaker got an internship interview via a project blog post).
    *   **Advanced:** Writing up a paper about your project (upload to arXiv).
    *   **Expert/Final Boss:** Getting a paper published at a reputable conference.
*   **Benefits:** Proves practical ability, showcases understanding, and builds a professional portfolio.

### Conclusion: Perseverance and Fun

*   **Time Commitment:** Learning ML takes significant time, depending on your starting point and dedication.
*   **Challenges:** Expect to struggle with math or coding – this is normal.
*   **Key Advice:** Don't give up, and try to have fun throughout the process.
